# liri-node-app

#### LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. The command line parameters are:

1. concert-this
1. movie-this

#### Once the command line is entered, for the concert-this entry you can add your favorite artist to find their concert dates and location. For movie-this you will be able to type the movie name and get back information on that specific movie.
